1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,196
What if you could make your sleep more efficient?

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,956
As a sleep scientist,

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,876
this is the question that has captivated me

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,460
for the past 10 years.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,756
Because while the lightbulb and technology have brought about a world

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,236
of 24-hour work and productivity,

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,916
it has come at the cost

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,236
of our naturally occurring circadian rhythm

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,460
and our body's need for sleep.

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,276
The circadian rhythm dictates our energy level throughout the day,

11
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:49,156
and only recently we've been conducting a global experiment on this rhythm,

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,236
which is putting our sleep health

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,660
and ultimately our life quality in jeopardy.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,316
Because of this,

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,476
we aren't getting the sleep we need,

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,236
with the average American sleeping a whole hour less

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,756
than they did in the 1940s.

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,036
For some reason,

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,316
we decided to wear it as a badge of honor

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,580
that we can get by on not enough sleep.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,940
This all adds up to a real health crisis.

22
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:20,356
Most of us know that poor sleep is linked to diseases

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,116
like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease,

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,180
stroke and diabetes.

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,516
And if you go untreated with a sleep disorder like sleep apnea,

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,300
you're more likely to get many of these illnesses.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,300
But did you know about sleep's impact on your mental states?

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,556
Poor sleep makes us make risky, rash decisions

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,540
and is a drain on our capacity for empathy.

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,956
When sleep deprivation literally makes us more sensitive to our own pain,

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,996
it's not so surprising that we have a hard time relating to others

32
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,236
and just generally being a good and healthy person

33
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,740
when we're sleep-deprived.

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,116
Scientists are now starting to understand

35
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,316
how not only the quantity

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,140
but also the quality of sleep impacts our health and well-being.

37
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,996
My research focuses

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,036
on what many scientists believe is the most regenerative stage of sleep:

39
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,260
deep sleep.

40
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,076
We now know that generally speaking,

41
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,716
there are three stages of sleep:

42
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,076
light sleep,

43
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,116
rapid eye movement or REM

44
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,340
and deep sleep.

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,580
We measure these stages by connecting electrodes to the scalp, chin and chest.

46
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,876
In light sleep and REM,

47
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,140
our brain waves are very similar to our brain waves in waking life.

48
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,636
But our brain waves in deep sleep have these long-burst brain waves

49
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,796
that are very different from our waking life brain waves.

50
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,220
These long-burst brain waves are called delta waves.

51
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,876
When we don't get the deep sleep we need,

52
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,076
it inhibits our ability to learn

53
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,900
and for our cells and bodies to recover.

54
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,916
Deep sleep is how we convert all those interactions

55
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,636
that we make during the day

56
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,380
into our long-term memory and personalities.

57
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,276
As we get older,

58
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,796
we're more likely to lose these regenerative delta waves.

59
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,636
So in way, deep sleep and delta waves

60
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,300
are actually a marker for biological youth.

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,036
So naturally, I wanted to get more deep sleep for myself

62
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,756
and I literally tried almost every gadget, gizmo, device and hack out there --

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,716
consumer-grade, clinical-grade,

64
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,940
what have you.

65
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,356
I learned a lot, and I found I really do need, like most people,

66
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,036
eight hours of sleep.

67
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,116
I even shifted my circadian component

68
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,836
by changing my meals, exercise and light exposure,

69
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,116
but I still couldn't find a way to get a deeper night of sleep ...

70
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,196
that is until I met Dr. Dmitry Gerashchenko

71
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,516
from Harvard Medical School.

72
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,716
Dmitry told me about a new finding in the literature,

73
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,156
where a lab out of Germany showed that if you could play certain sounds

74
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,716
at the right time in people's sleep,

75
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,180
you could actually make sleep deeper and more efficient.

76
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,556
And what's more, is that this lab showed

77
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,076
that you actually could improve next-day memory performance

78
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,300
with this sound.

79
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,276
Dmitry and I teamed up,

80
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,796
and we began working on a way to build this technology.

81
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,899
With our research lab collaborators at Penn State,

82
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,676
we designed experiments in order to validate our system.

83
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,316
And we've since received grant funding from the National Science Foundation

84
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,356
and the National Institute of Health

85
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,300
to develop this deep-sleep stimulating technology.

86
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,876
Here's how it works.

87
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,156
People came into the lab

88
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,556
and we hooked them up to a number of devices,

89
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,356
two of which I have on right here --

90
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,636
not a fashion statement.

91
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,180
(Laughter)

92
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,836
When we detected that people were in deep sleep,

93
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,516
we played the deep-sleep stimulating sounds

94
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,196
that were shown to make them have deeper sleep.

95
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm going to demo this sound for you right now.

96
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,860
(Repeating sound waves)

97
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,636
Pretty weird, right?

98
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,396
(Laughter)

99
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,876
So that sound is actually at the same burst frequency as your brain waves

100
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,236
when your brain is in deep sleep.

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,516
That sound pattern actually primes your mind

102
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,180
to have more of these regenerative delta waves.

103
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,836
When we asked participants the next day about the sounds,

104
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,756
they were completely unaware that we played the sounds,

105
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,660
yet their brains responded with more of these delta waves.

106
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,996
Here's an image of someone's brain waves from the study that we conducted.

107
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,716
See the bottom panel?

108
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,236
This shows the sound being played at that burst frequency.

109
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,356
Now look at the brain waves in the upper part of the graph.

110
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,316
You can see from the graph

111
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,820
that the sound is actually producing more of these regenerative delta waves.

112
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,756
We learned that we could accurately track sleep

113
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,476
without hooking people up to electrodes

114
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,596
and make people sleep deeper.

115
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,036
We're continuing to develop

116
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,476
the right sound environment and sleep habitat

117
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,820
to improve people's sleep health.

118
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,076
Our sleep isn't as regenerative as it could be,

119
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,916
but maybe one day soon,

120
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,356
we could wear a small device

121
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,460
and get more out of our sleep.

122
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,076
Thank you.

123
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,860
(Applause)
